## **REQUEST #001 - BUG FIX REQUEST**

**Title**: Railway Deployment Converter Output Size Fix  
**Date**: September 18, 2025  
**Status**: Pending Approval  
**Priority**: Critical  

### **Request Summary**
Fix Railway deployment issue where JPK to JSON conversions produce 97% smaller output files (80KB vs 2.6MB locally) due to missing library dependencies causing early termination.

### **Why Needed**
- Railway conversions appear successful but produce incomplete/incorrect output
- Processing time suspiciously fast (0.13s vs 3-4s locally) indicating early exit
- False positive success rate masking critical functionality failure

### **Key Files Referenced**
- `docs/plan_timeoutfix.md` - Complete implementation plan
- `jpk2json/converter.py` - Core converter requiring dependency fixes
- `jpk2json/lib/*.json` - Missing library files (6 critical files)
- `jpk2json/tmp/*.json` - Missing temporary files (2 optional files)
- `src/routes/flask_async_converter.py` - Flask routes needing diagnostic endpoints
- `src/main.py` - App startup requiring validation
- Railway deployment configuration

### **Contextual Information**
- **Current Railway Output**: 80,479 bytes in 0.134 seconds
- **Expected Output**: ≥2,500,000 bytes in ≥3 seconds
- **Root Cause**: Missing library dependencies in Railway environment
- **Components Affected**: 116 total components, unknown how many loading on Railway
- **Diagnostic Data Available**: Admin endpoints show 1 conversion, 100% false success rate

### **Complexity Analysis**

**Complexity Rating**: 8/10 (High)

**Breakdown**:
- **Phase 1** (Diagnostic Enhancement): 3/10 - Straightforward logging additions
- **Phase 2** (Dependency Verification): 6/10 - File deployment and build process changes
- **Phase 3** (Path Resolution): 7/10 - Complex environment-aware path handling
- **Phase 4** (Deployment Validation): 5/10 - Health checks and startup validation
- **Phase 5** (Testing & Validation): 9/10 - Comprehensive test suite development

**Risk Factors**:
- **High**: Railway build process modifications
- **Medium**: Path resolution across different environments
- **Medium**: Potential for breaking existing functionality
- **Low**: Logging and diagnostic additions

**Dependencies**:
- Railway deployment access and configuration
- Understanding of Railway file system structure
- Knowledge of converter library file requirements
- Flask application architecture familiarity

**Estimated Effort**: 8-13 hours across 5 sequential phases

**Success Criteria**:
- Railway output ≥2.5MB (currently 80KB)
- Processing time ≥3 seconds (currently 0.13s)
- All 116 components loading successfully
- Content hash matching between Railway and local
- Comprehensive diagnostic and monitoring capabilities

**Story Points**: 13 points
- Phase 1: 2 points (logging)
- Phase 2: 3 points (deployment)
- Phase 3: 3 points (path resolution)
- Phase 4: 2 points (validation)
- Phase 5: 3 points (testing)
