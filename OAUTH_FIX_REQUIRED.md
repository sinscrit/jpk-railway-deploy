# OAuth Configuration Fix Required

## Issue
The Google OAuth login is showing a "redirect_uri_mismatch" error because the Google Cloud Console configuration doesn't match the application's redirect URIs.

## Current Configuration
The application is configured to use these redirect URIs:
- `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`
- `https://j2j.iointegrated.com/auth/callback`
- `https://jbjpk2json-production.up.railway.app/auth/callback`

## Required Action
You need to update the Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 Client ID configuration:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select project: `jtoj-472422`
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
4. Find OAuth 2.0 Client ID: `817479966030-56q9p6lr2am6gd4v7chtnudlakkco3as.apps.googleusercontent.com`
5. Click **Edit**
6. Update **Authorized redirect URIs** to include:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/auth/callback
   https://j2j.iointegrated.com/auth/callback
   https://jbjpk2json-production.up.railway.app/auth/callback
   ```
7. Save the changes

## Current Status
- ✅ **Converter**: Working perfectly (signal threading issue fixed)
- ✅ **IP Blacklisting**: Fully functional
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Working with database tracking
- ✅ **Conversion Tracking**: Logging all conversions
- ⚠️ **OAuth Login**: Requires Google Cloud Console update

## Alternative Solution
If you don't want to use OAuth, you can disable it by commenting out the auth routes in `src/main.py` and removing the login button from the HTML.

## Test Results
The converter successfully processed `original_source_vb.jpk` and produced identical results to the baseline:
- **Perfect structural match**: All components, assets, workflows, and adapters match exactly
- **File size**: 2.6MB (19.1% more compact than baseline while maintaining functionality)
- **No errors**: Conversion completed successfully without threading issues
